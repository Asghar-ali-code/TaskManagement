The development process involves the utilization of branches to facilitate efficient collaboration among developers. Developers are encouraged to create branches for their respective tasks, enabling them to work on features or fixes independently. Additionally, developers have the flexibility to create their own branches derived from the development branch.

The pre-production branch serves as a staging area for code before it is deployed to the production environment. This branch allows for comprehensive testing and validation before the code is promoted to the main production branch.

The main branch is reserved exclusively for production-ready code. Once code has undergone thorough testing in the pre-production branch and is deemed ready for deployment, it is merged into the main branch. This ensures that only stable and validated code is deployed to the production environment.
